## Hello earthlings, Zen here 👋

I just recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh (2019) as a Psychology graduate 🎓 and am now working as a research assistant at the Clinical Brain Lab, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). 

### Interests

- Neural dysfunction and how it affects human behaviour and cognition 🧠​🏥​⚕️​
- Specifically, I am most interested in understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying memory (especially false memories and confabulation), decision-making, and inhibitory control, and how best we can model these processes ​🕵️‍♂️​
- You can also find me climbing at a bouldering gym 🧗 or on a football pitch getting some ⚽ kicks in!

### Works

In my first year dabbling in research after graduation, I started using GitHub :octocat: and ever since then I have been actively involved in this amazing open-science community!

- On **GitHub**, I am currently contributing to
  - [Neurokit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit): a Python toolbox for Physiological Signal Processing
  - [ComplexSpan](https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan): a PsychoPy implementation of a Working Memory Span task
  - [AutoRemind](https://github.com/zen-juen/AutoRemind): An Email Reminder Automation System for Research Participants

I'm currently writing a R package to facilitate and automate norming of neuropsychological assessment data: [NeuropsyNorms](https://github.com/zen-juen/NeuropsyNorms) ðŸ§  

My previous involvements include the following **Neuropsychology/Cognitive psychology** projects:
 - [Neurokit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit): a Python toolbox for Physiological Signal Processing
 - [ComplexSpan](https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan): a PsychoPy implementation of a Working Memory Span task
 - [Pyllusion](https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion): A Parametric Framework to Generate Visual Illusions using Python
 
You can also check out some of my individual side-projects that I created to **automate research procedures** in general:
 - [AutoRemind](https://github.com/zen-juen/AutoRemind): An Email Reminder Automation System for Research Participants
 - [AutoCalendar](https://github.com/zen-juen/AutoCalendar): A Python automation scheduling system based on the Google Calendar API

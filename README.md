## Hello earthlings, Zen here 👋

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh (2019) as a Psychology graduate 🎓 and am now working as a research assistant at the [Clinical Brain Lab](http://www.clinicalbrain.org/), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). 

### Interests

- Neural dysfunction and how it affects human behaviour and cognition 🧠​🏥​⚕️​
- Specifically, I am most interested in understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying memory (especially false memories and confabulation), decision-making, and inhibitory control, and how best we can model these processes ​🕵️‍♂️​
- You can also find me climbing at a bouldering gym 🧗 or on a football pitch getting some ⚽ kicks in!

### Works

In my first year dabbling in research after graduation, I started using GitHub :octocat: and ever since then I have been actively involved in this amazing open-science community!

- I am actively contributing to these **Neuropsychology/Cognitive psychology** projects:
  - [Neurokit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit): a Python toolbox for Physiological Signal Processing
  - [ComplexSpan](https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan): a PsychoPy implementation of a Working Memory Span task
 
 - You can also check out some of my individual side-projects that I created to **automate life** in general:
   - [AutoRemind](https://github.com/zen-juen/AutoRemind): An Email Reminder Automation System for Research Participants
   - [AutoCalendar](https://github.com/zen-juen/AutoCalendar): A Python automation scheduling system based on the Google Calendar API

## Hello earthlings, Zen here 👋

I just recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh (2019) as a Psychology graduate and am now working as a research assistant at the Clinical Brain Lab, Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

### Passions

My passions are in neural dysfunction and how it affects human behaviour and cognition. Specifically, I am most interested in understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory (especially false memories and confabulation), decision-making, and inhibitory control, and how best we can model these processes ​🕵️‍♂️​

### Works

I previously conducted research in the field of **Memory**, specifically associative false memory using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, as well as flashbulb memories. I am now currently working on **Cognitive Neuroscience of Deception** projects at the Clinical Brain Lab at NTU. I hope to further research on memory dysfunction in the field of clinical neuropsychology ​🧠​🏥​⚕️​

In my first year dabbling in research after graduation, I started using GitHub :octocat: and ever since then I been actively involved in this amazing open-science community!

- On **GitHub**, I am currently contributing to
  - [Neurokit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit): a Python toolbox for Physiological Signal Processing
  - [ComplexSpan](https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan): a PsychoPy implementation of a Working Memory Span task
